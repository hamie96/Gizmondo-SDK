CE_ICMPSTATS_OBJ_009_NAME=CE ICMP Statistics
CE_ICMPSTATS_OBJ_009_HELP=Remote CE ICMP Statistics
CE_MESSAGES_009_NAME=Messages
CE_MESSAGES_009_HELP=Specifies the number of messages received.
CE_MESSAGES_PER_SEC_009_NAME=Messages/sec
CE_MESSAGES_PER_SEC_009_HELP=Specifies the number of messages received per second.
CE_ERRORS_009_NAME=Errors
CE_ERRORS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of errors received.
CE_DESC_UNREACHABLE_009_NAME=Unreachable Destinations
CE_DESC_UNREACHABLE_009_HELP=Specifies the number of destination-unreachable messages received. A destination-unreachable message is sent to the originating computer when a datagram fails to reach its intended destination.
CE_TIME_EXCEDED_009_NAME=Exceeded TTL Messages
CE_TIME_EXCEDED_009_HELP=Specifies the number of time-to-live (TTL) exceeded messages received. A time-to-live exceeded message is sent to the originating computer when a datagram is discarded because the number of routers it has passed through exceeds its time-to-live value.
CE_PARAM_PROBLEMS_009_NAME=Parameter Problems
CE_PARAM_PROBLEMS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of parameter problem messages received. A parameter problem message is sent to the originating computer when a router or host detects an error in a datagram's IP header.
CE_SOURCES_QUENCHES_009_NAME=Source Quench Messages
CE_SOURCES_QUENCHES_009_HELP=Specifies the number of source quench messages received. A source quench request is sent to a computer to request that it reduce its rate of packet transmission.
CE_REDIRECTS_009_NAME=Redirects
CE_REDIRECTS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of redirect messages received. A redirect message is sent to the originating computer when a better route is discovered for a datagram sent by that computer.
CE_REDIRECTS_PER_SEC_009_NAME=Redirects/sec
CE_REDIRECTS_PER_SEC_009_HELP=Specifies the number of redirect messages received per second.
CE_ECHOS_009_NAME=Echos
CE_ECHOS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of echo requests received. An echo request causes the receiving computer to send an echo reply message back to the originating computer.
CE_ECHOS_PER_SEC_009_NAME=Echos/sec
CE_ECHOS_PER_SEC_009_HELP=Specifies the number of echo requests received per second.
CE_ECHO_REPS_009_NAME=Echo Replies
CE_ECHO_REPS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of echo replies received. A computer sends an echo reply in response to receiving an echo request message.
CE_ECHO_PER_SEC_REPS_009_NAME=Echo Replies/sec
CE_ECHO_PER_SEC_REPS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of echo replies received per second.
CE_TIMESTAMPS_009_NAME=Time Stamp Requests
CE_TIMESTAMPS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of time-stamp requests received. A time-stamp request causes the receiving computer to send a time-stamp reply back to the originating computer.
CE_TIMESTAMPS_PER_SEC_009_NAME=Time Stamp Requests/sec
CE_TIMESTAMPS_PER_SEC_009_HELP=Specifies the number of time-stamp requests received per second.
CE_TIMESTAMPS_REPS_009_NAME=Time Stamp Replies
CE_TIMESTAMPS_REPS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of time-stamp replies received. A computer sends a time-stamp reply in response to receiving a time-stamp request. Routers can use time-stamp requests and replies to measure the transmission speed of datagrams on a network.
CE_TIMESTAMPS_PER_SEC_REPS_009_NAME=Time Stamp Replies/sec
CE_TIMESTAMPS_PER_SEC_REPS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of time-stamp replies received per second.
CE_ADDRESS_MASKS_009_NAME=Address Mask Requests
CE_ADDRESS_MASKS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of address mask requests received. A computer sends an address mask request to determine the number of bits in the subnet mask for its local subnet.
CE_ADDRESS_MASKS_REPS_009_NAME=Address Mask Responses
CE_ADDRESS_MASKS_REPS_009_HELP=Specifies the number of address mask responses received. A computer sends an address mask response in response to an address mask request.
