This sample shows all the platman objects registered
and any sub-objects regsitered.

This uses the new automation features of platman to
enumerate collections of platforms, bootable devices,
service categories, CPUs, OSs, Toolkits, and Properties.

With each platform, the sample shows the enumeration of
all remote devices, startup servers, transports, and
associated CPUs and OS.

The sample uses VB tree control to display the objects
in a heirarchical fashion similar to a registry viewer.
